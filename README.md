# PID Control for Ball on Beam

This repository contains the source code and related resources for implementing a PID controller for a ball on a beam system. The PID controller (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) is used to achieve precise and stable tracking of the system under various conditions.

## Key Features:

- Implementation of the PID algorithm for position control.
- Adaptable to various situations and scenarios of the ball on the beam.
- Detailed documentation and code comments to facilitate understanding and extension.
- Examples and simulations illustrating the system behavior under different configurations.

## Additional Study PDF Information:

- The PDF presents a study on the design of a position servomechanism to control the position of a ball on a beam by controlling the angle formed by the beam with the horizontal plane.
- A block diagram of the position servomechanism is provided, including the relationship between the angular position of the motor output shaft and the input voltage to the motor.
- It is demonstrated that the system is unstable when using a proportional-integral action regulator, using stability criteria and Python simulations.
- The use of a proportional position sensor at one end of the beam is described, which relates voltage to the ball's position.
- It is justified that using a proportional-derivative action regulator ("PD regulator") can stabilize the system, and stability criteria are applied to determine the values of Kp and Kd that make the system stable.
- The authors of this project are Arnau González Almirall and Miriam de Juan Borrás, students at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.
